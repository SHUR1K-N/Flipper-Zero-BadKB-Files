### For other firmwares:

## Warning
Please *always* read scripts like these from top to bottom and ensure you understand every line before you go and execute them on your machine on anyone else's. It would only take a single shell command to exfiltrate data or harm your system irreversibly.

## Disclaimer
* None of these scripts were created by me. I have collected these from various repositories, and may have made some modifications for the sake of optimization/convenience to some of them
* If you do not know what you are doing with these files, you should probably not try
* These files were uploaded for the purposes of education, research, and experimentation with devices you yourself own. I neither endorse nor shall be held responsible for any potentially unethical or malicious activity from *your* usage of these files
